We therefor foster an open culture of cooperation, fair-trade, transparency, open source development and collaboration accross borders.

🤲 We offer an open hand and an invitation to connect in a community and a professional context, documenting, sharing information and experience for the benefit of all.

🟢 GOALS

 
Our goals are (but not limited to):
• improving the availability, accessibility, quality and transparency of hemp products in general and this in a spirit of ecological recalibration of industries.  
• implementing local vertical integration of hemp processing to develop circular production and waste streams that are biodegradable.
• create platforms for applied techniques with the hemp plant in terms of design (textiles, fashion and productdesign) and development.
• provide education, opportunity and means to support community self sustainability and an exchange of information, knowledge and tools.
• creating and supporting communities around the hemp plant
• creating a broad, solid financial structure in which the customers are also shareholders 
• project-support for various hemp related projects

We are convinced hemp can be implemented as a tool to improve our environment as well as te provide an alternative for polluting industries, giving an incentive to modernize and innovate.
